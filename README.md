Additional information
In addition to the above, you may want to include the following information in your README.md file:

A description of your app, including what it does and how to use it.
Screenshots or videos of your app in action.
A link to your app's GitHub repository or other code hosting site.
A list of known issues and bugs.
Contribution guidelines.
You should also update your README.md file whenever you make significant changes to your app, such as adding new features or fixing bugs.

Notes on your package.json file
I noticed that you are using two different navigation libraries in your package.json file: react-navigation and @react-navigation/native. It is generally best to choose one navigation library and stick to it. This will help to make your code more consistent and easier to maintain.

I also noticed that you are using a resolutions field in your package.json file to resolve a conflict between different versions of the @types/react dependency. This is a good practice, and it will help to ensure that your project builds successfully.

Conclusion
I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you have any other questions.
